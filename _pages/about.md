This project builds on [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie), a Jekyll theme which is simple and opinionated, which itself is a fork of [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) with some additional features and personal touches which I've implemented to suit my needs for [my blog](https://www.amitmerchant.com).

Learn more about it [here](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) on how to get started.

The goal of this project is to help you set up and deploy a fully fledged static website using a browser and a GitHub account. See [How](/getting-started).
